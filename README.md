# rAviExp
R library for Aviation Exploratory design.

It is designed to solve for parameters managing multiple mathematical models in a customizable workflow. There are basic numerical functions, wrappers and especially S3 Objective functions that recognizes the type of analysis.

Unlike CAD/CAE/CAM or flight simulators or calculation gadgets. This is intended to be functional (closure) type so the modells can be more easily called at different stages of initial design calculation. The users are encouraged to record their work process in R script so that it can be easily rewritten and modified if needed at any stage.

Different models have different initial assumptions and because it is programmable (can be called with R), they can be easily customized, at different levels. Theoretically you can customize the parameters at any stage and change the decisions by simply editing the lists but the use of %takein% parameters are encouraged.

This version is the 1st released version of AviExp project.

I intend to make the project open-source and it follows the GPL_V3.0

I hope this could make the designer's life easier.
